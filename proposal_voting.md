# Voting on Proposals

In order for proposals to be passed and accepted, they require votes. Voting as a masternode owner can be done simply within the Java Wallet.

To begin voting, locate a proposal that you'd like to vote on. After some research, and looking over the users proposal, you decide you'd like to vote on the last proposal on the list.

To vote for the proposal, copy the TX HASH in the first column. Paste that into the text field below.

Now that you've copied and pasted the TX HASH, you can then edit the parameters of your vote. The three dropdowns to the right of the text input section pertain to the following information:

- Object Funding - Select `funding` to vote for funding. The other options `delete` and `valid` are used by sentinel and should not be selected.
- Vote Option - The options for voting are `YES`, `NO` or `ABSTAIN`.
- Masternode to vote from - Dropdown list of your masternodes to choose from.

The Vote Buttons do the following:

- Vote Alias - Vote with your selected masternode. 
- Vote All - Vote with all your masternodes (all masternodes will vote the same as the selected option)

Once you're ready, you can click either the Vote Alias button or the Vote All button. After which you should receive an output summarizing your votes. It should look something like this (with your masternode aliases):
